The delay in each case is 750 ms and we want to cycle between CYAN, MAGENTA and YELLOW in that order. The first colour is CYAN, which is green and blue. So we turn those on first, and add a delay afterwards of 750ms.\n\n```norun;\nvoid loop() {\n  Esplora.writeRGB(0, 255, 255); \/\/ set LED cyan\n  delay(750);\n}\n```\n\nThe next colour we need to add is MAGENTA. Which is made up for RED and BLUE, which means setting the RED to 255, and the GREEN to maximum value of 255, and the BLUE to 0.\n\n```norun;\nvoid loop() {\n  Esplora.writeRGB(0, 255, 255); \/\/ set LED cyan\n  delay(750);\n  Esplora.writeRGB(255, 0, 255); \/\/ set LED magenta\n  delay(750);\n}\n```\n\nFinally, we want to set the LED YELLOW, which is setting RED and GREEN to 255. It is important to remember to add the final delay after we have done this. Because when we finish the loop() function, we immediately start it over again. \n\nThe complete solution is below.\n",

We want blue to also be on for 500 ms, so we add a delay after that.\n\n```norun;\nvoid loop() {\n  Esplora.writeRGB(255, 0, 0); \/\/ set LED red\n  delay(500);\n  Esplora.writeRGB(0, 0, 255); \/\/ set LED blue\n  delay(500);\n}\n```\n\nAnd we're done!

This can be done the following way:\n```norun;\nint slider = Esplora.readSlider();\nint index = map(slider, 1023, 0, 0, 11);  \/\/ note the slider is flipped from the previous activity\n```\nThe important thing to note is the *slider is flipped*. This can be done by swapping the second and third numbers in the `map` function.\n\nThen check the button has been presses to emit a tone, or twice that tone if button 2 is pressed, and turn the tone off when it is not pressed.\n\n```norun;\nif (Esplora.readButton(1) == PRESSED) {\n  Esplora.tone(note[index]);\n}\nelse if (Esplora.readButton(2) == PRESSED) {\n  Esplora.tone(2 * note[index]);\n} \nelse {\n  Esplora.noTone();\n}\n```\nAlternatively, you could change the array around.

We do this by adding a statement to the original `if` statement in the following way:\n\n```norun;\nif (Esplora.readSlider() > 512) {\n  Esplora.writeRGB(255, 0, 255);\n}\n```\nWhen the slider is less than or equal to 512, then we want the LED to be *green*.

It should then loop from 1000 Hz back to 700 Hz. \n\nIn both cases it should change by 5Hz each time, and each note should last for *20 milliseconds* before the next note starts.\n\nThe siren should activate when *joystick x* moves over 100 from it's start position, and when the joystick is in the 0 position there should be no tone after the siren has completed.\n\nHere is what it should sound like at the end.
